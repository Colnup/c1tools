# c1tools

My personnal set of tools, managed through a simple `c1` cli command.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install --with-editable "." .
```

## Notes

This software is provided as-is. I have not yet decided to publish it with a FOSS license. Forks are for now tolerated as long as you don't use it for commercial purposes.

Since this is my *personal* set of tools, I may accept contributions, but you might be better off forking this project and modifying it to suit *your* needs.
